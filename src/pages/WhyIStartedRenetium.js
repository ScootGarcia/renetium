          Why I started Renetium
        </h1>
  
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
          I didn’t set out with a big plan. I just wanted to explore photography and find a better way to learn by doing. 
          Around the same time, I started getting into web development. Renetium brings those two things together — a place where I can share what I'm learning, 
          practise building a site, and hopefully connect with others doing the same.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Combining two creative worlds</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Photography and coding don’t seem related at first, but I’ve found they’re both creative in different ways. 
          Photography helps me look closer at the world, notice light and detail. Coding gives me the tools to build something real, 
          something I can keep improving. Renetium is where those two interests meet — and evolve.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">A site that grows with me</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          I’m just getting started — both with photography and web development. I built Renetium using React, Tailwind CSS, GitHub, and a bit of help from AI tools. 
          It’s not perfect (and that’s the point). Every time I learn something new, I try to apply it here. The site is a work in progress, just like me.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">A community for beginners — and beyond</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          While Renetium began as a personal project, I’d love for it to become something more. 
          If you're starting out in photography, or even if you’ve been doing it for years and want to share tips, feedback, or stories — you’re welcome here. 
          Articles, forum chats, gear talk — anything that helps us grow together.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Where it’s going</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          This site is just the beginning. I’ll be writing about things I’m learning, the gear I’m experimenting with, and how the site itself evolves over time. 
          I’ll also share the coding side of things — how I’m using AI to build and design better. If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. 
          Even better — say hello.
